# Project dAppForge

## Introduction

dAppForge is an AI-powered plug-in for Polkadot developers that reduces development time. The AI model is explicitly fine-tuned for substrate and ink!

Substrate is arguably one of the best modular frameworks for building blockchains. It leverages Rust’s features to enable the creation of blockchains that are highly customizable, performant, and secure.

ink! is an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for the Rust programming language. it is specifically designed for writing smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains. It provides a set of macros and tools that allow developers to build and manage smart contracts efficiently, leveraging Rust's capabilities while being optimized for Substrate’s environment.

## Architecture

- AWS API Gateway, Websockets, Lambda, and DynamoDb for the API.
- Typescript and React for the VS Code plugin.
- AI LLM hosted on AWS.
